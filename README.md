# SERVERLESS URL SHORTENER

A URL Shortener is a service that creates short **aliases for URLs**. It generates a short code for a URL and then redirects the user to the URL when that code is accessed. One example of such service is [bitly](https://bitly.com/).

## How does it work?
To keep this file short I moved all details to other file: [HOW.md](HOW.md)
